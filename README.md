# Help Scout PHP Code Standards
================================================================================
>

This repository includes the [Help Scout][dev] coding standard definition for [PHP Codesniffer][phpcs] and resources. The PHP_CodeSniffer standard will never be 100% accurate, but should be viewed as a strong set of guidelines while writing software at Help Scout.

These are most commonly used with the [Pre-Commit][pre-commit] commit hooks for linting source code with the [php-cs hook][php-cs].
